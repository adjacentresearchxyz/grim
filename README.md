# Grim: Global Risk Simulator

A Telegram bot for simulating and role-playing global risk scenarios. Players can take on different roles and interact with scenarios through actions and information sharing. You can read more about the motivation behind it here: [Scaling Wargaming for Global Catastrophic Risks with AI](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/scaling-wargaming-for-global-catastrophic-risks).

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: with `bun install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the following tokens:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
```

You can get an Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/), which provides access to Claude Sonnet 3.7, the model used by this application. You can get a Telegram bot token by following instructions [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot) (messaging the @BotFather account on Telegram.)

## Usage

1. Start the bot: `bun src/grim.ts`. Optionally, you can provide a scenario file, `bun src/grim.ts --scenario-file file_name`. There is an example scenario file called `scenario.example.txt` if you want to get up and running quickly.
1. Set your role with `/role <Your Name> - <Your Role>`
1. Start the scenario with `/scenario <scenario_description>`. You don't need to provide `scenario_description` if you used a `scenario_file`
1. Once the scenario is started, you can use these commands:
- `/info` - Queue an information request about the current situation
- `/feed` - Queue information to incorporate into the world state
- `/action` - Queue an action you want to take in the world
- `/process` - Process all queued actions
- `/remove` - Remove an item from the action queue
- `/rollback` - Roll back the scenario to a previous checkpoint
